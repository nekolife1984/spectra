## Requirements

<!-- @spec 1 -->
### Requirement 1: {{REQUIREMENT_AREA_1}}
<!-- Requirement headings MUST include a leading numeric ID only (for example: "Requirement 1: ...", "1. Overview", "2 Feature: ..."). Alphabetic IDs like "Requirement A" are not allowed. -->
**Objective:** As a {{ROLE}}, I want {{CAPABILITY}}, so that {{BENEFIT}}
<!-- IMPORTANT: This numeric ID (1, 2, 3...) is used in @impl tags (e.g., # @impl 1.1) and .trace-mapping.yaml id fields. Do not change. -->

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. When [event], the [system] shall [response/action]
2. If [trigger], then the [system] shall [response/action]
3. While [precondition], the [system] shall [response/action]
4. Where [feature is included], the [system] shall [response/action]
5. The [system] shall [response/action]

<!-- @spec 2 -->
### Requirement 2: {{REQUIREMENT_AREA_2}}
**Objective:** As a {{ROLE}}, I want {{CAPABILITY}}, so that {{BENEFIT}}
