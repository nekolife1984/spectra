# Release Notes

New features and improvements for spectra (forked from cc-sdd). See [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) for technical changes.

> ⚠️ **Note (this fork)**: These release notes reflect the historical evolution of the project from v0.1.0 through v3.0.2 under the original `cc-sdd` name. As of this fork, the project is published as **spectra** (v3.0.2 baseline). Command examples using `npx cc-sdd@latest` are historical; the current install command is `npx github:nekolife1984/spectra`. PR links still point to `gotalab/cc-sdd` because that is where the original work was submitted.

---

## 🔬 In Development (Unreleased)

No unreleased features at this time. The latest stable release is v3.0.2.

## 🔧 Ver 3.0.2 (2026-04-14) – Patch Fixes & Docs Cleanup

### Summary
Patch release that keeps the Codex `spectra-reviewer` role valid for cross-spec review and removes a README reference that no longer aligns with cc-sdd.

### Fixed
- Added the missing `description` field to the Codex `spectra-reviewer` template so Codex keeps the custom role available instead of ignoring it as malformed ([#160](https://github.com/nekolife1984/spectra/pull/160))

### Documentation
- Removed the README Amazon book reference after the linked title shifted to promote `ai-sdd`, a closed-source clone of cc-sdd without attribution ([#157](https://github.com/nekolife1984/spectra/pull/157))

### Resources

## 🛡️ Ver 3.0.1 (2026-04-11) – Path Safety Hardening

### Summary
Patch release focused on safer filesystem handling in `cc-sdd`, plus a small follow-up fix for mojibake and English wording.

### Fixed
- Fixed the mojibake in the Claude Code Skills `spectra-impl` template so the feature-flag protocol renders the `→` arrow correctly ([#154](https://github.com/nekolife1984/spectra/pull/154))

### Security
- Hardened manifest, template, and shared-rule path handling so generated file operations stay within their expected roots
- Rejected unsafe traversal-style inputs and writes through symlinked destinations during execution ([#155](https://github.com/nekolife1984/spectra/pull/155))

### Documentation
- Updated a few English docs lines to replace `team-scale AI-driven development` with the more natural `AI-driven development at team scale` ([#155](https://github.com/nekolife1984/spectra/pull/155))

### Resources
- **Pull Requests**: [#154](https://github.com/nekolife1984/spectra/pull/154), [#155](https://github.com/nekolife1984/spectra/pull/155)

## 🎉 Ver 3.0.0 (2026-04-10) – Skills Mode & Autonomous Implementation

### 🎯 Highlights
- **Agent Skills as the primary workflow**: cc-sdd now centers on `--*-skills` installs and a unified 17-skill workflow across 8 platforms.
- **Specs you can run**: `/spectra-discovery`, `/spectra-batch`, and long-running autonomous `/spectra-impl` turn approved specs into an execution control plane, not just project documents.
- **Native subagent dispatch**: autonomous implementation, review, and debug loops now live inside cc-sdd without relying on the external Ralph Loop project.

### ✨ Added
- Skills-based agents for Cursor, GitHub Copilot, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, and Antigravity, alongside upgraded Claude Code Skills and Codex Skills support ([#141](https://github.com/nekolife1984/spectra/pull/141))
- New workflow entry points:
  - `/spectra-discovery` for idea triage and roadmap routing
  - `/spectra-batch` for parallel multi-spec creation
  - `/spectra-impl` for autonomous implementation with reviewer/debugger loops ([#141](https://github.com/nekolife1984/spectra/pull/141))
- New rules/templates for boundary-first planning, design synthesis, review gates, task decomposition, and steering customization under `.spectra/settings/` ([#141](https://github.com/nekolife1984/spectra/pull/141))
- `cc-sdd-new-agent`, a SOP-style skill for adding or migrating supported agents ([#141](https://github.com/nekolife1984/spectra/pull/141))

### 🔧 Changed
- Default install target is now `claude-code-skills`, making skills mode the out-of-the-box experience ([#141](https://github.com/nekolife1984/spectra/pull/141))
- Documentation, onboarding, and positioning have been rewritten around the v3 workflow and “long-running autonomous implementation” model ([#141](https://github.com/nekolife1984/spectra/pull/141))
- Issue auto-close automation now activates only when maintainers intentionally apply the `awaiting-response` label ([#138](https://github.com/nekolife1984/spectra/pull/138))

### ⚠️ Breaking / Migration Notes
- Skills mode is now the primary path. Command-based installs remain deprecated and should be migrated to `--*-skills`.
- `--codex` prompts mode is no longer supported; use `--codex-skills` instead.
- If you previously relied on external Ralph Loop orchestration, move to the built-in `/spectra-impl` autonomous flow.

### 📖 Migration Guide
- See [docs/guides/migration-guide.md](../guides/migration-guide.md) for upgrade guidance.

---

## 📝 Ver 2.0.3 (2025-11-15) – GPT-5.1 Codex tuning

- Refined recommended OpenAI models for Codex CLI, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf to explicitly include `gpt-5.1-codex medium/high` as the primary code-focused option, with `gpt-5.1 medium/high` as a general-purpose fallback.
- Updated DEV_GUIDELINES-related tests so they match the stricter language-handling rules introduced in v2.0.2, keeping runtime behavior unchanged while ensuring `npm test` passes cleanly for v2.0.3.

- Resources: [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md#203---2025-11-15), PR: [#104](https://github.com/nekolife1984/spectra/pull/104)

---

## 📝 Ver 2.0.2 (2025-11-15) – GPT-5.1 & spec stability

- Optimized prompts and agent defaults for GPT-5.1 by recommending `GPT-5.1 high or medium` for Codex CLI, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf.
- Tightened language handling so all generated Markdown (requirements, design, tasks, research, validation) uses the spec’s target language and falls back to English (`en`) when `spec.json.language` is not set.
- Made EARS patterns and traceability more consistent by keeping EARS trigger phrases in English, localizing only the variable slots, and enforcing numeric requirement IDs (e.g. `Requirement 1`, `1.1`, `2.3`) so requirements → design → tasks mappings are stable and fail fast when IDs are missing or invalid.

## 🎉 Ver 2.0.0 (2025-11-09) – Stable Release

### Highlights at a Glance
- **`npx cc-sdd@latest` = full stack SDD**: all alpha capabilities (research.md, validation commands, Subagents, Windsurf) are now GA.
- **Spec-to-impl fidelity**: Research/Design/Tasks templates now enforce requirement IDs, component density rules, and Supporting References for long-form details.
- **Brownfield guardrails**: `/spectra-validate-*` commands, parallel-task analysis, and steering-wide project memory reduce drift before any code change.
- **Global parity**: 7 AI agents × 13 languages share the same templates, prompts, and installation flow.

### Upgrade Essentials
1. Follow the [Migration Guide](../guides/migration-guide.md) for template layout changes (`.spectra/settings/templates/*`) and new steering behavior (directory-wide load).
2. Update automation/scripts to call `npx cc-sdd@latest` (the `@next` tag is reserved for future previews).
3. Regenerate steering + spec templates once to pick up Research.md, the new design rules, and tasks parallel markers.

### Key Capabilities in this release
- **Parallel Task Analysis** – automatic `(P)` markers + `--sequential` escape hatch.
- **Research.md Template** – isolates discovery logs and architectural trade-offs from the design SSOT.
- **Design Template Overhaul** – summary tables, requirement coverage, Supporting References, and heavy component blocks only where they matter.
- **Agent Coverage** – Claude Code + Subagents, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, Copilot, Qwen, Windsurf with matching 11-command workflows.
- **Interactive Installer** – guided setup with project-memory handling, npm badges, and improved documentation navigation.

### Resources
- Full technical diff: see [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md#200---2025-11-09).
- Migration specifics: [docs/guides/migration-guide.md](../guides/migration-guide.md).
- PLAN references: `docs/cc-sdd/v2.0.0/PLAN.md` for release tasks, `docs/cc-sdd/v2.0.0/PLAN2.md` for design-template scope.

Once your project templates are regenerated on v2.0.0, all spec/todo automation should operate without additional flags.
