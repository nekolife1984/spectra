# spectra Migration Guide


> ⚠️ **Note (this fork)**: This guide is maintained as part of the **spectra** project (forked from `gotalab/cc-sdd` at v3.0.2). Tool names and command examples have been updated to the spectra name; PR links to `gotalab/cc-sdd` are preserved as historical references. Legacy command samples using `npx cc-sdd@...` reflect the version in which the example was written and are kept for continuity.

spectra 1.x (especially 1.1.5) and 2.0.0 share the same agentic SDLC philosophy and command list, but the **design artifacts, templates, and steering structure were rebuilt from the ground up**. Use this guide to pick one of two clear paths—either keep running 1.1.5 as-is, or accept the discontinuity and move to 2.0.0 where templates/rules make customization instant.

---

## TL;DR – choose your path

| Goal | Recommended action |
| --- | --- |
| Keep the legacy 1.x workflow untouched | Run `npx cc-sdd@1.1.5` whenever you install/refresh files. Continue editing agent-specific prompt folders (only the original 8 spec/steering commands exist). |
| Adopt unified templates, research/design split, and consistent behavior across all 8 supported agents | Reinstall with `npx github:nekolife1984/spectra` (=2.0.0) and customize only `.spectra/settings/templates/*` plus `.spectra/settings/rules/` (full 11-command set, including validate-*). |

> ⚠️ Mixing 1.x and 2.x layouts in the same `.spectra` tree is not supported. Pick one path per repo/branch.

### What carries over unchanged

- `.spectra/specs/<feature>/` directories you already authored remain valid inputs; simply regenerate newer templates when you are ready.
- `.spectra/steering/` (or a single `steering.md`) can be reused as-is—the content is still consumed verbatim as project memory.
- The 11 commands (`spec-*`, `validate-*`, `steering*`) and the high-level spec→design→tasks→impl flow stay identical; only the template internals have moved to a just-in-time, agentic style.

---

## 1. Staying on spectra 1.1.5 (fallback option)

1.1.5 is no longer on `@latest`, but you can pin it explicitly:

```bash
npx cc-sdd@1.1.5 --claude-code   # legacy flag name (use --cursor / --gemini / etc. for others)
npx cc-sdd@1.1.5 --lang ja       # legacy i18n flags still work
```

- You can keep editing `.claude/commands/*`, `.cursor/prompts/*`, `.codex/prompts/*` などのエージェント別フォルダを直接編集するスタイルで運用できます。
- Agent-specific directory layouts stay exactly as they were in v1.
- No new features will land here—future work targets `@latest` only.
- The validate commands (`/spectra-validate-gap`, `-design`, `-impl`) do **not** exist in 1.1.5. If you rely on those gates, migrate to v2.

---

## 2. Why 2.0.0 is worth the jump

> The core workflow (spectra-init → design → tasks → impl, with validation gates) and the 11 command entry points are unchanged. What changed is **where you customize and how much structure the resulting docs provide.**

- **Template & rules driven customization** – stop patching commands; edit `.spectra/settings/templates/` and `.spectra/settings/rules/` once and every agent picks it up.
- **Spec fidelity** – Research.md captures discovery logs while Design.md becomes reviewer friendly with Summary tables, Req Coverage, Supporting References, and lighter Components/Interfaces blocks.
- **Steering = Project Memory** – drop structured knowledge across `.spectra/steering/*.md` files and every command consumes it.
- **Brownfield guardrails** – `/spectra-validate-gap`, `validate-design`, `validate-impl` plus the research/design split make gap analysis and existing-system upgrades much safer.
- **Unified coverage** – all 8 supported agents in v2 (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Qwen Code, OpenCode, Windsurf) run the same 11-command workflow, so mixing agents (e.g., Cursor + Claude) requires zero spec rewrites. Claude Code also has an optional `--claude-agent` install target that adds a subagent-accelerated `spectra-quick` flow.

## 3. Recommended migration steps

1. **Backup**
   ```bash
   cp -r .spec .spec.backup
   cp -r .claude .claude.backup   # repeat for .cursor, .codex, …
   ```

2. **Install v2 cleanly (reuse interactive choices)**
   ```bash
   npx github:nekolife1984/spectra                 # default (Claude Code)
   npx github:nekolife1984/spectra --cursor        # other agents
   npx github:nekolife1984/spectra --claude-agent  # Subagents mode
   ```
   - The installer now prompts per file group (overwrite / append / keep). You can choose “append” for steering/specs to merge existing documents, or “keep” to skip untouched assets.

3. **Regenerate + merge templates/rules**
   - New layout: `.spectra/settings/templates/` (centralized) + `.spectra/settings/rules/`.
   - Compare the new templates with any custom logic you previously kept inside agent prompt folders and move the reusable parts into templates/rules.

4. **Move custom rules**
   - Place Markdown files under `.spectra/settings/rules/`. Every spec/design/tasks command reads them.
   - Anything you previously hard-coded into prompts becomes a rule entry (“DO/DO NOT …”).

5. **Rebuild steering (optional)**
   - Split project memory into files such as `project-context.md`, `architecture.md`, `domain-knowledge.md`.
   - Research/design templates reference this folder, so migrate existing notes here.

6. **Update automation**
   - Point all scripts/docs to `npx github:nekolife1984/spectra`; retire `@next` usage.
   - Map old manual command invocations to the 11 supported ones (`spec-*`, `validate-*`, `steering*`).

## 4. Mapping legacy edits to v2

| Legacy touchpoint | v2 replacement | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.claude/commands/spectra-design.prompt.md` などエージェント別コマンドファイル | `.spectra/settings/templates/specs/design.md` | Templates now live in `.spectra/settings/templates/` and generate Summary/Supporting References automatically. |
| `.claude/commands/<cmd>.prompt`, `.cursor/prompts/*` | `.spectra/settings/rules/*.md` | Replace prompt edits with shared rule statements so every agent receives identical guidance. |
| `.spectra/steering/` (single file or not) | `.spectra/steering/*.md` with clearer principles/guides | Same folder path; v2 simply encourages breaking content into focused project-memory guides. |
| Research notes interleaved in design.md | `.spectra/specs/<feature>/research.md` + Supporting References section | Design stays reviewer friendly; research keeps raw findings without cluttering the main body. |

## 5. v2.x to v3.0

> v3.0 applies to all `--*-skills` install targets. Skills modes are now available for 8 platforms: Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, and Antigravity. Commands-based agents (`--claude-code`, `--cursor`, etc.) still work but are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

### TL;DR

| Area | v2.x | v3.0 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Skill count | 12-13 | **17** |
| Discovery | Basic idea refinement | **Routing/scoping entry point**; writes `brief.md` and, when needed, `roadmap.md` |
| Spec batch | N/A | **`/spectra-batch`** -- parallel multi-spec creation with cross-spec review |
| Implementation | `spectra-impl` (single-pass) | **`/spectra-impl`** -- unified skill with native subagent dispatch (implementer + reviewer + debugger) |
| `--codex prompts` mode | Supported | **Blocked** (use `--codex-skills` instead) |
| Session persistence | None | **`brief.md`** persists across sessions; downstream skills read it automatically |
| TDD protocol | Basic TDD | **Feature Flag TDD**: RED then GREEN protocol for safe incremental delivery |
| Codex cross-spec review | N/A | **`.codex/agents/spectra-reviewer.toml`** for Codex installs |
| Debug on failure | N/A | **Debug subagent** -- fresh context investigation with web search (max 2 rounds) |
| Learnings propagation | N/A | **Implementation Notes** in tasks.md injected into subsequent implementer prompts |
| Skills platforms | Claude Code, Codex | **8 platforms**: Claude, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Antigravity |

### Key migration steps

1. **Reinstall** with the latest version (skills mode for your platform):
   ```bash
   npx github:nekolife1984/spectra --claude-skills     # Claude Code (default)
   npx github:nekolife1984/spectra --codex-skills      # Codex
   npx github:nekolife1984/spectra --cursor-skills     # Cursor IDE
   npx github:nekolife1984/spectra --copilot-skills    # GitHub Copilot
   npx github:nekolife1984/spectra --windsurf-skills   # Windsurf IDE
   npx github:nekolife1984/spectra --opencode-skills   # OpenCode
   npx github:nekolife1984/spectra --gemini-skills     # Gemini CLI
   npx github:nekolife1984/spectra --antigravity       # Antigravity
   ```

2. **Remove legacy skill references** -- if you have custom scripts or documentation referencing `spectra-impl`, update them to `/spectra-impl`.

3. **Adopt the new entry point** -- start new features with `/spectra-discovery` instead of jumping straight to `/spectra-init`. Discovery now produces `brief.md` and `roadmap.md` that feed into downstream skills.

4. **Use `/spectra-batch`** for multi-feature work -- when your roadmap contains multiple specs, `/spectra-batch` creates them in parallel and runs a cross-spec review to catch contradictions.

5. **Migrate from legacy modes** -- all non-skills modes (`--claude`, `--cursor`, `--copilot`, `--windsurf`, `--opencode`, `--gemini`) are deprecated and will be removed. `--codex` is already blocked. Use the corresponding `--*-skills` flag.

6. **Leverage `brief.md` for session continuity** -- after discovery, you can close the session and resume later. The brief file preserves the feature context so you do not need to re-explain scope.

### What carries over unchanged

- All spec phases (steering, init, requirements, design, tasks) work identically.
- `.spectra/specs/<feature>/` directory structure is the same.
- Steering documents, templates, and rules are fully compatible.
- `/spectra-validate-impl` behaviour is unchanged.

## 6. FAQ / troubleshooting

**Can I reuse old templates inside v2?** – Technically yes, but you lose Req Coverage and Supporting References, so generation quality drops. Prefer porting content into the new templates/rules.

**Can I switch between 1.1.5 and 2.0.0 in one repo?** – Only if you isolate `.spectra` per branch or automate swapping directories; the layouts conflict.

**After editing templates, which commands should I run?** – At minimum: `/spectra-steering`, `/spectra-init`, `/spectra-design` to regenerate Research/Design/Tasks with the new format.

---

## 7. Takeaways

- **Stay on 1.1.5** if you just need the legacy workflow—pin the version and continue as before.
- **Move to 2.0.0** if you want unified templates, Supporting References, research/design separation, and minimal maintenance via rules.
- Future features and fixes target v2+, so upgrading unlocks the full spec-driven development experience.
